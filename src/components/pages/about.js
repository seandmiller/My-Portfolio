       <p>
         Born in Jamaica came to America at the age of 9, my journey to becoming a software engineer was not a
         normal one. The moment I left highschool I went straight into acting, while I was acting I was keeping up with tech in my free 
         time. On one of my random reading escapades I discovered Tesla and the type of technology they were working on. At that 
         moment everything changed for me and a small passion for tech was slowly brewing till it became too hard to ignore and that's 
         how I ended up here, hoping I can contribute little that I have to humanity.
